// TODO: Add declarative syntax for screens.
//    One way would be to have array of screens in typical order and
//    use that to go back and next. Enum may be a better option.

// Also would be good to have declarative way to determine whether to show
// NavigationBar or not. Currently this is within the view controller itself.
// Also pop from navigatin controller or not.
